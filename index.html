                I'm pursuing my PhD at the <a href="https://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/research/digital-media-technology" style="color: #ffffff;">Digital Media Technology Lab</a>
                in Birmingham City University. My research focuses on understanding collaboration in AR Environments.

            <p style=" font-size: 18px;">Taking you back to 2014, where I chose A-Level Art (inc. 3D-Design), Triple Science, and IT. You are not very wrong; very diverse subjects. I was trailing on what I enjoyed and trying to find the passion! Soon, the dark times (of UCAS and personal statement) were upon me. I made the decision to choose Computer science. Thinking back, it is probably the influence of me fixing BSOD and replacing the keyboard of the Family Laptop. Technology had started to grow on me.
